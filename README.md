# Risk-Based Customer Segmentation

## Project Overview
In today's data-driven banking environment, understanding customer behavior is crucial for managing risk and providing personalized financial services. This project focuses on customer segmentation based on behaviors, transaction patterns, and risk profiles, enabling banks to improve risk management, enhance fraud detection, and deliver more tailored products and services.
## Key Features
- **Risk Assessment**: Analyze customer data to evaluate risk levels.
- **Segmentation Models**: Employ clustering and classification techniques for segmentation.
- **Visualization**: Generate insightful visualizations to interpret the segmentation results.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values.
   - remove columns based on association,correlation and domain knowlegde
   - encode the data
   - Normalize and scale the data.
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Derive new features to enhance model performance.
3. **Modeling**:
   - Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering).
   - Evaluate performance using metrics such as silhouette score.
4. **Visualization**:
   - Use tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize clusters.

## Results
- Customers are segmented into distinct groups based on risk.
- Visualizations provide actionable insights for business decision-making.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
